# Mecatronica-Proyecto

Welcome! We are Santiago Fenés Guardia, Jorge Rando Hernández and Alberto León Luengo, also known as 'Los Ultramarines 3.0', and in this repository you will find all the material used to carry out the final project of the Mechatronics subject for the 2023/2024 course.

Below is a brief description of each of the directories that make up this repository:

- [2D-3D models/](https://github.com/aleon2020/Mecatronica-Proyecto/tree/main/2D-3D%20models) directory: Contains all the sketches used to design the pieces that make up our project. Inkcape files contain the dimensions of each of the pieces, while FreeCAD files contain a 3D model of each of them.

- [media/](https://github.com/aleon2020/Mecatronica-Proyecto/tree/main/media) directory: Contains all the images, videos, GIFs and multimedia files used to document our project's wiki.

- [src/](https://github.com/aleon2020/Mecatronica-Proyecto/tree/main/src) directory: Contains all the source code files implemented in our project.

Once all this has been explained, the corresponding link to the wiki is attached, where our entire project is explained in more detail:
